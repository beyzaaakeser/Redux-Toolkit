<h1>My TodoApp - Redux Toolkit</h1>

A Todo application that I developed with Redux Toolkit provides a modern interface where users can add, update, and delete tasks. In the application, the Redux Toolkit is used for status management, and the adding, deleting, and updating of tasks are managed centrally. Users can easily edit each Todo and delete completed tasks, which improves the user experience. Each task is identified with unique IDs created using the UUID library, thus ensuring data integrity. The application offers a modern look with Bootstrap and icons enriched using React Icons.

<h2> The following technologies were used in the frontend development phase of my site: </h2>
